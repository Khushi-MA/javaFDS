# Food Distribution System
**Nourishing Lives, One Meal at a Time**

## Project Mission
Our Food Management System is a dedicated initiative aimed at efficiently distributing surplus food from various sources—restaurants, supermarkets, and individuals—to those in need. Our mission is to combat hunger, reduce food waste, and foster a compassionate community by ensuring that surplus food is promptly and systematically delivered to the poor and hungry.

**Join us in making a difference and ensuring that no one goes to bed hungry.**

## SDG Connection
**SDG 12.3:**  
By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels, and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.

Our project addresses this by diverting surplus food to those in need, minimizing waste, and supporting local food security.
